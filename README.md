# 99_bottles
A humorous remake of the 99 Bottles of Beer song. The parody replaces bottles of beer on the wall with errors and bugs in the code.
</br></br>
To keep with programmer humor, rather than follow a straight decrement, the script uses the [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) to calculate the next iteration.
```
Take any positive integer n. 
If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. 
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
Repeat the process indefinitely. 

The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1. 
```
This more closely follows real-world programming due to the nature of computer bugs.
```
99 errors and bugs in the code,
99 errors and bugs.
Take one down, patch it around,
298 errors and bugs in the code.

298 errors and bugs in the code,
298 errors and bugs.
Take one down, patch it around,
149 errors and bugs in the code.

149 errors and bugs in the code,
149 errors and bugs.
Take one down, patch it around,
448 errors and bugs in the code.

448 errors and bugs in the code,
448 errors and bugs.
(...)
```
An ironic twist is that this method actually takes less time to terminate than the original song (25 iterations instead of 99)
